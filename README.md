# Arka
A CLI tool to provide projects templates. The purpose was to create a package manager for C / C++, since most modern languages had one. That's why we are more dedicated towards C templates. 

# Supported languages
- PostCSS, Sass, Less
- JavaScript, TypeScript
- C++, C, C3
- Rust
- Golang

# Templates
The templates are added by pull requests, and are usually made to build projects and integrate libraries / scripts easier.
